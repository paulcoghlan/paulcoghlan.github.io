My setup is based on two $39/£29 IKEA Skurup desk lamps.
I bought some Osram Zigbee E14 LED lights from Amazon UK when they were discounted to £4.49, and with the help of a vice I very carefully popped the plastic cover off:</description><content>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve built an automated home studio lighting setup for less than $100 which I believe produces more flattering images whilst being unobtrusive enough to look
part of a typical desk environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My setup is based on two $39/£29 &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/skurup-work-wall-lamp-black-80471143/">IKEA Skurup&lt;/a> desk lamps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought some Osram Zigbee E14 LED lights from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0747VDHG3">Amazon UK&lt;/a> when they were discounted to £4.49, and
with the help of a vice I very carefully popped the plastic cover off:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/2021/IMG_4514.jpg" alt="Osram lamp with top cover off">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(notice there are two bits of glue on the cover - maybe a heat gun would have made it easier?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what the modified bulb looks like in the lamp:

&lt;p>I ordered a 3mm thick acrylic disc cut to the measured size of the lamp interior (117mm) from &lt;a href="https://www.simplyplastics.com/catalog/discs/cast-acrylic-round-discs/led-light-diffusing-opal-acrylic-disc/c-24/c-93/p-962">SimplyPlastics&lt;/a>. I think the result isn&amp;rsquo;t too shabby:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The great thing about using Zigbee lights is that I can automate the whole setup and control all of the lights and the camera from a button (I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant&lt;/a>. The lights can be automatically configured to the correct color temperature for the time of day. More to come on that in another post!&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
