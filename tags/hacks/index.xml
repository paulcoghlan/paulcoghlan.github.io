My setup is based on two $39/£29 IKEA Skurup desk lamps.
I bought some Osram Zigbee E14 LED lights from Amazon UK when they were discounted to £4.49, and with the help of a vice I very carefully popped the plastic cover off:</description><content>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve built an automated home studio lighting setup for less than $100 which I believe produces more flattering images whilst being unobtrusive enough to look
part of a typical desk environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My setup is based on two $39/£29 &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/skurup-work-wall-lamp-black-80471143/">IKEA Skurup&lt;/a> desk lamps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought some Osram Zigbee E14 LED lights from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0747VDHG3">Amazon UK&lt;/a> when they were discounted to £4.49, and
with the help of a vice I very carefully popped the plastic cover off:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/2021/IMG_4514.jpg" alt="Osram lamp with top cover off">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(notice there are two bits of glue on the cover - maybe a heat gun would have made it easier?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what the modified bulb looks like in the lamp:

&lt;p>I ordered a 3mm thick acrylic disc cut to the measured size of the lamp interior (117mm) from &lt;a href="https://www.simplyplastics.com/catalog/discs/cast-acrylic-round-discs/led-light-diffusing-opal-acrylic-disc/c-24/c-93/p-962">SimplyPlastics&lt;/a>. I think the result isn&amp;rsquo;t too shabby:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The great thing about using Zigbee lights is that I can automate the whole setup and control all of the lights and the camera from a button (I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant&lt;/a>. The lights can be automatically configured to the correct color temperature for the time of day. More to come on that in another post!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Diy Teleprompter</title><link>/posts/diy-teleprompter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 15:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/diy-teleprompter/</guid><description>Being able to look someone in the eye is something we take for granted when we meet someone face-to-face, but this is tricky with desktop monitors.
I wanted a compact, inexpensive teleprompter to fit between my two desktop monitors to show me my Zoom window and look directly at my webcam.
The problem with the less expensive teleprompter models is that they tend to be made of plastic, and so unable to support anything heavier than a tablet/phone.</description><content>&lt;p>Being able to look someone in the eye is something we take for granted when we meet someone face-to-face, but this is tricky with desktop monitors.&lt;/p>

The problem with the less expensive teleprompter models is that they tend to be made of plastic, and so unable to support anything heavier than a tablet/phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My solution was to mount a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B076CBHMQM/">7&amp;quot; field monitor&lt;/a> to my monitor stand and attach the &lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001323460983.html">telepromter&lt;/a> to that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve found SmallRig components to be excellent value and quality. I used a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B076HLBZDX/">Magic Arm&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CIHRKM4/">Cool Cheese Bar&lt;/a> to attach everything to a monitor mount. I also added some Sugru (blue!) to keep the teleprompter stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still need to tidy up the cabling a bit, but otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with the solution.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
