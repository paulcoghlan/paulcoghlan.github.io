I'm running Windows 11 on my PC with a view to using it for Linux-based projects on WSL2/WSLg.
This means I'd like to spend a lot of time in terminal windows - however I have a UK ISO-layout
keyboard (Keychron K8) setup for a Mac... This means I need to remap various keys in software to 
maintain my sanity!

I know there is a nifty "Apple/Windows" slider on the side of the keyboard, but for ergonomic 
reasons I'd prefer not to have to use it.
