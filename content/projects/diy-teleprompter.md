Being able to look someone in the eye is something we take for granted when we meet someone face-to-face, but this is tricky with desktop monitors.

I wanted a compact, inexpensive teleprompter to fit between my two desktop monitors to show me my Zoom window and look directly at my webcam.  
The problem with the less expensive teleprompter models is that they tend to be made of plastic, and so unable to support anything heavier than a tablet/phone.

My solution was to mount a [7" field monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B076CBHMQM/) to my monitor stand and attach the [telepromter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001323460983.html) to that.

I've found SmallRig components to be excellent value and quality.  I used a [Magic Arm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B076HLBZDX/) and [Cool Cheese Bar](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CIHRKM4/) to attach everything to a monitor mount.  I also added some Sugru (blue!) to keep the teleprompter stable.

I still need to tidy up the cabling a bit, but otherwise I'm really happy with the solution.
